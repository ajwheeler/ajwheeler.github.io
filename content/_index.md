I'm a Flatiron Software Research Fellow at the Flatiron Institute. Before that I was a postodc at Ohio State University, and before that I was a grad student at Columbia University, where my advisor was [Melissa Ness](https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/melissa-ness).

My central research interest is stellar spectroscopy and related data analysis problems.  I develop [Korg.jl](https://github.com/ajwheeler/Korg.jl).
